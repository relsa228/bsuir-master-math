# BSUIR Math works (Master degree)
This repository contains my works which have been created during my master's degree at BSUIR (_Informatics and Programming Technologies_ | _Big Data Processing_).

## CAS
Computation algebra system. My experiments with SageMath system. Contains various examples and solutions from simple commands to differential equations, Fourier transforms, complex numbers, and more.

## Machine Learning
Primary part of ML course. My first experience with Tensorflow (love it so much). Starts with simple models (like linear regression) and go to full numbers recognition network through fully connected and convergent neural networks
